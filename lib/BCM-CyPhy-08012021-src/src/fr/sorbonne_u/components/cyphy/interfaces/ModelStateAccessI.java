/**
 * The interface <code>ModelStateAccess</code> defines how a component embedding
 * a simulation model can access a value that resides in the simulation model.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * When performing software-in-the-loop (SIL) simulations, the software must
 * be able to access values that resides in the simulation models. Typically,
 * the simulation will provide values of variables that replace values that
 * would be given by measures in actual executions. In SIL, a fake sensor must
 * access the model value rather than an actual measured value.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is meant to be implemented by simulation plug-ins that would
 * be called by services (methods) in BCM components.
 * </p>
