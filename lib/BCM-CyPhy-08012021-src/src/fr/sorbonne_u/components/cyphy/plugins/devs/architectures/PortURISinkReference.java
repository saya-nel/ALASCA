/**
 * The class <code>PortURISinkReference</code> defines a reference to a
 * sink model that must receive external events that will require a component
 * connection to be put in place.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In the DEVS simulation library used to integrate DEVS simulation models with
 * BCM components, models have to exchange external events directly with the
 * receiving model. The library is implementing that with a plain Java
 * reference, but when the two models are held by two distinct components, the
 * connection must use BCM component interfaces, ports and connectors. This
 * class allows to describe the reference with the URI of the other model
 * inbound port, thus the sending model component can connect using the
 * corresponding outbound port.
 * </p>
