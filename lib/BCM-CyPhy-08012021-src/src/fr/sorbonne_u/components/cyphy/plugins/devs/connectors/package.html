This software is a computer program whose purpose is to provide an extension
of the BCM component model that aims to define a components tailored for
cyber-physical control systems (CPCS) for Java.

This package is a part of a library that integrates DEVS simulation models in
Java with the BCM component model also written in Java. DEVS allows to define
modular simulation models that are composed through coupled models by
interconnecting them in order to exchange events. Coupled models also play
a coordination role when executing simulation runs by repeatedly selecting their
next submodel having a transition to be executed and giving them the control to
perform the transition.
</p>
<p>
When integrating DEVS with BCM, modular simulation models will be distributed
among components. Hence, when calls or data exchanges will be needed among them,
these will have to use BCM component interfaces, ports and connectors. This
package defines the necessary connectors.
