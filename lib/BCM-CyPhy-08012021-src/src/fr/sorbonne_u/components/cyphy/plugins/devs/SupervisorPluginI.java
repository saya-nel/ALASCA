/**
 * The interface <code>SupervisorPluginI</code> declares the core services of
 * the DEVS simulation supervisor plug-in.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface gathers the different interfaces a supervisor plug-in
 * must implement to provide the behaviours required by this role in a DEVS
 * simulation context:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>SupervisorPluginManagementI</code> declares methods used by
 *   other components to make the supervisor component create simulators
 *   from simulation architecture descriptions and perform simulation
 *   runs and campaigns.</li>
 * <li><code>SupervisorPluginManagementI</code> declares methods used from
 *   the supervisor component in order to manage simulation runs by calling
 *   the simulators on components holding them.</li>
 * <li><code>SupervisorNotificationI</code> declares methods used by simulators
 *   in components to call back the supervisor (essentially to return the
 *   simulation reports at the end of simulation runs.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Created on : 2016-07-15</p>
