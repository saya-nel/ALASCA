This software is a computer program whose purpose is to provide an extension
of the BCM component model that aims to define a components tailored for
cyber-physical control systems (CPCS) for Java.

This package defines three different plug-ins related to the integration of
DEVS simulation models into BCM components. DEVS is a simulation standard
allowing to define modular models that are either atomic or coupled. Atomic
models are used to define user-specific models while coupled models are used
to compose models to create progressively full-fledged simulators for whole
systems.
</p>
<p>
The basic idea behind integrating simulation models into components is to
allow the users to specify the behaviour of the component using models that
are executable. These models can be used to validate the design of a
cyber-physical system that will be constructed as a component assembly.
In this first phase, standalone model-in-the-loop simulators can provide a
theoretical validation. During the development process, software-in-the-loop
simulators can be coupled with the software developed in components to debug
and test it, until the full system is developed and then its software can be
verified and validated. At deployment, hardware-in-the-loop simulators can be
used for final verification and validation of the full cyber-physical system
in its target physical environment.
</p>
<p>
The three plug-ins defined in this package correspond to three roles that
components can play in a simulation:
</p>
<ol>
<li>atomic simulator, that executes both atomic models or coupled models seen
  as atomic (thanks to the closure over composition property of DEVS models)
  that reside within one component;</li>
<li>coordinator, that executes coupled models which amounts to coordinating the
  submodels;</li>
<li>supervisor, that manages simulations which amounts first to create and
  interconnect simulation architectures and then to manage simulation runs
  by providing simulation run parameters, execute runs and then retrieve
  simulation reports to analyse their results.</li>
</ol>
