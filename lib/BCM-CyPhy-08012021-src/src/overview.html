This software library provides an extension of the BCM component model that
aims to define a components tailored for cyber-physical control systems (CPCS).
This model aims at supporting both the programming of CPCS and a development
methodology as well as software engineering for such systems.
</p>
<p>
<i>This library is an on-going research work; as such, it will be modified
perhaps profoundly until a satisfactory result will be obtained.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Introduction</i></p>

<p>
Cyber-physical control systems are very hard to develop, debug, test, verify,
validate, configure at deployment time as well as monitor and adapt to changes
in their context of execution. A component model tailored to CPCS must help
addressing these difficulties by providing specific component definitional
elements as well as a composition operation among them that help developers to
tackle these issues.
</p>
<p>TODO: complete</p>

<p>
Among the capabilities that a CPCS component model should provide to help
debugging and testing CPCS is to be able to simulate cyber and physical
processes at different degrees of realism. CPCS are often first functionally
specified by behavioural models which can be tuned and assessed through
model-in-the-loop (MIL) simulations. Instead of developing separate models
with distinct tools (such as MatLab), we propose to provide CPCS components
that include in their definitions both behavioural and simulation models
allowing to specify them with a high degree of correctness guarantees.
MIL simulators can then be constructed by composing the simulations models
of the components and then running them through simulation campaigns to verify
and validate them.
</p>
<p>
Next, after developing the software part of the CPCS components, simulation
models can be added to perform software-in-the-loop simulations where the
simulation models are defined in such a way to cooperate with the software
to simulate/execute more faithfully the CPCS. Again, SIL simulators can be
obtained in parallel with the component assembly process by composing the
models and the same time components are composed to get progressively a
complete software system that can be debugged, tested, verified and validated
using SIL simulations.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the component-based CPCS can be deployed on some particular hardware
targets. The system will then have to be configured and run. During these
phases, hardware-in-the-loop simulations also using specific models can be
used to identify the system, to define precise parameters for control laws
as well as to adapt it to changes in the execution context.
</p>
<p>
This software provides yet another implementation of the DEVS simulation
standard for Java. The major contribution of this new implementation is the
ability to represent simulation models and architectures <i>i.e.</i>,
compositions of models, as first-class objects. 
</p>
<p>
DEVS is now a standard for modelling and implementing discrete event
simulations as well as discretised continuous time simulations.
Descriptions of this standard can be found in numerous papers and books.
Here, two books have been thoroughly used:
