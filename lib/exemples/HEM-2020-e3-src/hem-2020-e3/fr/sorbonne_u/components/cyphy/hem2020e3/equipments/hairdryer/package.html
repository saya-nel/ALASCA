This package defines a hair dryer component used in the Household Energy
Management example. It includes a SIL simulation described in its subpackage
<code>fr.sorbonne_u.components.cyphy.hem2020e3.equipments.hairdryer.sil</code>.
</p>
<p>
The hair dryer component is defined as an uncontrollable appliance in the
Household Energy Management example <i>i.e.</i>, an appliance that os totally
under the control of the user but can't be managed by the house energy manager.
A haire dryer can be turned on and  off, and when it is on it can be put in a
low (less hot and less consuming) or high (hotter and more consuming) mode.
The interface <code>HairDryerCI</code> proposes the corresponding services. 
</p>
<p>
The purpose of the Household Energy Management example is to be able to track
the electricity consumption of a house/flat in order to cut off some appliances
when the production of (green) electricity is insufficient. Hence, the
electricity consumption of the appliances must be simulated in order to perform
software testing without connection to the actual appliance. Here, SIL
simulation is sought, so the simulation models in the <code>sil</code>
subpackage are meant to cooperate with the code in the component.
</p>
<p>
To support this, the service implementations in the <code>HairDryer</code>
component will both keep track of the state of the hair dryer (switch on/off,
low/high mode) and trigger events in the simulation models to force state
changes and the update of the electricity consumption.
