This package defines the SIL simulation models for the hair dryer example.
The main characteristic of SIL models is to cooperate intimately with the
software to provide executions that are similar to actual ones. The hair
dryer has two major models:
</p>
<ol>
<li>A user model that mimics the actions of the user.</li>
<li>An electrical model that exports a continuous variable giving the current
  intensity of the hair dryer in ampere.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The model is meant to be used by an electric meter model that will sum the
intensities of the appliances in a house/flat. Hence, this electric meter model
will import the variables giving the intensities of the appliances in order to
sum them up. The constraints of BCM/DEVS force these models to be co-located
into one component, here a component representing the electric meter. Indeed,
simulation models in BCM/DEVS that reside on distinct components can
export/import events but not continuous variables. Continuous variables can
only be exported/imported among models that reside on the same component.
</p>
<p>
Here, the hair dryer model is split in two parts: one in the hair dryer
component which will cooperate with the software of this component and the
other in the electric meter component which will be composed with other
electrical models to give a simulation of the electricity consumption.
</p>
<p>
With this organisation in two parts, the hair dryer user model simulates actions
of the user as events, which execution will call the corresponding methods in
the hair dryer component (<i>e.g.</i>, the execution of the event
<code>SwitchOn</code> calls the service <code>turnOn</code> of the hair
dryer component). Each of these methods in the component needs to trigger a
state change in the hair dryer electrical model. Again, the constraint of
BCM/DEVS make possible for a component to trigger events in their own SIL
simulation models, but not models that reside inside other components.
Therefore, a third SIL simulation model is introduced: the hair dryer state
model. When a method in the hair dryer component needs to trigger a state
change in the hair dryer electrical model, it passes by this hair dryer state
model by triggering in it an event, which will be transmitted to the hair
dryer electrical model using the connection among simulators of distinct
components.
