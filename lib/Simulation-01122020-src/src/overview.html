This software provides yet another implementation of the DEVS simulation
standard for Java. The major contribution of this new implementation is the
ability to represent simulation models and architectures <i>i.e.</i>,
compositions of models, as first-class objects. Models defines explicitly
what they import and export with annotations. The software allows to describe
models and architectures then provides means to compose models explicitly in
a way that preserves a reified representation of the simulation models and
architecture at run time while maintaining efficiency in the execution.
</p>

<p><i>Introduction</i></p>

<p>
DEVS is now a standard for modelling and implementing discrete event
simulations as well as discretised continuous time simulations.
Descriptions of this standard can be found in numerous papers and books.
Here, two books have been thoroughly used:
</p>
<ol>
<li>B.P. Zeigler, H. Praehofer and T.G. Kim, Theory of Modeling and
  Simulation, 2nd edition, Academic Press, 2000.</li>
<li>B.P. Zeigler and H.S. Sarjoughian, Guide to Modeling and Simulation of
  Systems of Systems, Springer, 2013.</li>
</ol>
<p>
This implementation is also inspired by presentations of DEVS and its use to
implement the event scheduling view of discrete event simulations due to
H. Vangheluwe and especially the two following texts available on the WWW:
</p>
<ol>
<li>H. Vangheluwe, Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS)
  formalism, courseware, 2001.</li>
<li>H. Vangheluwe, Discrete Event Modelling and Simulation, courseware, 2001.
  </li>
</ol>

<p><i>Overall description</i></p>

<p>
Discrete event simulation is based on the idea of simulations proceeding by
repeatedly producing and executing events to evolve the state of a simulated
system at discrete point in simulation time. Though the approach seems to
exclude continuous time simulations, it must be observed that any
implementation of continuous time simulations on current digital computers
requires some form of discretisation of the continuous time, which turns out
to be expressible as discrete event simulations though at a different time
scale, a difference that may be crucial when implementing simulation engines.
</p>
<p>
The force of DEVS relies on three important concepts. First, the behaviour of
an atomic model is defined in terms of simulation steps and expressed as
a standard protocol <i>i.e.</i>, set of functions that a model must defined and
through which their semantics is defined. Second, atomic models are defined
independently but they can import and export events, called external events;
atomic models can be composed to form coupled models by connecting models
producing and exporting events to the ones importing and consuming (executing)
them. Finally, coupled models uses the atomic model protocol to coordinate the
composed atomic models <i>i.e.</i>, make sure that all of the atomic models
which have their own simulation clock progresses in the simulation in such a
way that no external event can be received by an atomic model with a time of
occurrence that appears to be in the past given the current receiving atomic
model clock.
</p>
<p>
An atomic simulation model is therefore meant to execute internal and external
events occurring at some simulation time to make its state evolve over the
simulation execution. DEVS imposes a standard protocol to define the operations
of an atomic model as functions (here Java methods) that will be called in a
loop by a simulation engine to make the simulation progress until the end
simulation time is reached. Each atomic model has its own simulation clock
that advances from events to events. Each internal event can produce external
events to be consumed by other models, hence a coupled model must make sure
that the simulation clocks of its atomic models progress in (sufficient)
synchrony so that no atomic model receives an external event to be executed at
some simulation time in it the past of the current simulation run. A coupled
model therefore coordinates its atomic models (or other coupled models as the
definition is recursive) to make sure that this constraint is obeyed at all
time. More precisely, the coordination must make sure that the result of a
simulation runs is not impacted by the distribution of the global simulation
model into a set of atomic a coupled models. Note that another important
property of DEVS simulation models is their closure over composition. This
property says that a coupled model resulting from the composition of a set of
other models (atomic and then also coupled) can also be viewed as an atomic
model, hence hiding its internal composition to the other models.
</p>
<p>
Yet another important point about DEVS is the separation of concern between
simulation models and simulation engines. A type of simulation engine defines
a particular simulation algorithm enacting a simulation model. Indeed,
simulation models may have specific data structures and methods used by their
corresponding simulation engine when executing the simulation. DEVS defines
standard basic discrete event simulation engine and simulation model but they
can be extended to other types of simulation engines and simulation models.
For example, the well-know discrete event simulation method using (future)
event scheduling can easily be implemented over the DEVS protocol by adding to
atomic models an event list storing the scheduled future events.
</p>
<p>
The major challenge tackled by DEVS is to propose a set of standard functions
for atomic and coupled models such that all of the different ways to perform
discrete event simulations can be expressed through these functions seen as
a simulation protocol. For example, the DEVS discrete event simulation models
do not impose a particular world view such as the event-scheduling world view.
However, event-scheduling models can be expressed as standard DEVS models and
composed with other standard models. Similarly, discretised continuous time
simulation models can also be expressed as standard DEVS models and composed
with other standard models. In this implementation of DEVS, standard models
are first defined and then event-scheduling ones are added as well as a form
of hybrid system mixed continuous/discrete models seen as hybrid input/output
automata (HIOA), proposed by Lynch et al. Extended atomic models are provided
and coupled models are proposed to be able to coordinate not only homogeneous
atomic models but also heterogeneous sets of standard, event-scheduling and
HIOA atomic models.
</p>

<p><i>The DEVS simulation protocol</i></p>

<p>
DEVS is a modelling framework allowing to specify modular discrete event
simulation models and to execute them either in a sequential lock-step,
concurrent or distributed manner.
</p>

<p>
The DEVS protocol for atomic models includes the following operations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>time advance: compute the remaining simulation time since the model
  arrived in the current state until making a transition to the next
  state;</li>
<li>output: compute the external events caused by the next occurring
  internal event which must be notified to other atomic models; this
  operation is called just before performing the corresponding internal
  transition;</li>
<li>internal transition: compute the next state from the current state and an
  occurring internal event, which may result into external output events to be
  notified to other atomic models provided by the operation output;</li>
<li>external transition: compute the next state from the current state, an
  occurring external input event and the elapsed time since the last event
  processed by the model.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Executing at current simulation time t an internal event processing for a DEVS
atomic model is done through the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Advance the simulation clock to t.</li>
<li>Compute the external output events and notify them to the other atomic
  models.</li>
<li>Execute the internal transition which transforms the current state into
  the next state according to the internal event that occurs.</li>
<li>Set the time of the last event to t.</li>
<li>Compute the time of the next internal event as t plus the time advance in
  the new state.</li>
<li>Notify the coordinator of the time at which the next internal event
  occurrence for this atomic model.</li>
</ol>

<p>
For a stand alone model, there are no external output events and these steps
are simply repeated by the simulation engine until the end of the simulation
by advancing the simulation clock to the time of the next internal event.
</p>

<p>
For a coupled (composite) model, a coordination is made to ensure the necessary
synchronisation of the simulation clocks of the simulators to maintain its
semantics. The standard DEVS coordination algorithm imposes a strict
synchronisation by forcing a sequential execution of the atomic models, each
of them being given the control to execute its next internal event step and
then each atomic model importing the external events produced by this internal
event step are given the control to execute their external event step. At the
end of an internal step and its triggered external event steps, the simulators
of the atomic model and its impacted ones notify their coordinator(s) with the
time of their next internal event occurrence. The coordination maintains the
global order of events by executing the next internal event occurring at the
earliest simulation time. When external output events are notified, they
are notified to the coordinator, which schedules their execution. Each time the
coordinator receives a notification from the currently running model with its
next internal event, it advances the simulation clock and activates the model
that must process the next internal event.
</p>

<p>
Executing at current simulation time t an external event e processing for a
DEVS atomic model is done through the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Cancel the next internal event currently predicted for the atomic model.
  </li>
<li>Get the elapsed time since the last event executed by this model.</li>
<li>Execute the external event step which transforms the current state into
  the next state given the elapsed time, the current time and the external
  event e that is occurring.</li>
<li>Set its time of the last executed event to t.</li>
<li>Compute the time of the next internal event as t plus the time advance in
  the new state.</li>
<li>Notify the coordinator the time of the next internal event occurrence.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
The DEVS protocol definition leaves some room for different implementations.
External events, for example, can either be sent to the coordinator, which will
transmit them to the destination models when giving them the control to
execute their external event step . But they can also be sent directly from the
exporting model to the importing ones without passing by the coordinator that
is only notified of the transmission. Also, the strict sequential execution of
atomic models can be replaced by  alternative implementations such as concurrent
execution. In this case, simulation clocks synchronisation is not ensured by
the coordination protocol, so another solution must be provided. Some systems
tolerate totally unsynchronised executions where most of the times external
events received after their time of occurrence are simply ignored. For systems
where some synchronisation is required, a time-triggered synchronisation scheme
can be adopted based on an execution forcing the simulation clocks of the
atomic models to follow the real time (for example, by scheduling event
processing as real time tasks based on the computers clock). But even with this
scheme, some external event may be received in the past of some models due to
the communication delays among computers. Again, some systems may tolerate to
simply ignore those events. Others may want to execute them but at the current
simulation time, but then this may end up changing the order of execution of
events. For systems requiring an execution of events in strict order, a
concurrent execution may be maintained but with roll back when an external
event is received from another atomic model in the past of the simulation clock.
This <i>time warp</i> mechanism has been used with success for some systems.
All of these solutions to get better performance from a concurrent execution
of discrete events simulation have advantages and drawbacks, the compromises
are strongly system-dependent.
</p>

<p><i>This implementation of DEVS</i></p>

<p>
Given the potential variations in implementing the DEVS protocol, this library
is based on the following choices:
</p>
<ul>
<li>DEVS allows to define different kinds of simulation models and
  corresponding coordination engines. This library implements standard
  DEVS models, event-scheduling view discrete event models and hybrid
  discrete/continuous models allowing to simulate hybrid systems and
  inspired by hybrid input/output automata as proposed by Lynch
  <i>et al.</i> that are able to exchange discrete events but also share
  continuous variables.</i>
<li>Standard DEVS atomic models exchange external events directly without
  passing by their parent coupled models. However, atomic models that receive
  events during a simulation step notify their parent models to be scheduled
  for an external event transition during the current simulation step.</li>
<li>In DEVS, hierarchies of models can either be homogeneous when all models
  are defined by reference to a single kind of simulation engine or
  heterogeneous when they are defined in reference to different simulation
  engines. Using the closure under composition of DEVS models, an homogeneous
  hierarchy of models can be created as tightly coupled composition where
  coupled models directly call their submodels (rather than passing by
  simulation engines) and in a way to be seen as an atomic model themselves;
  then only one atomic simulation engine needs to be used for the whole
  hierarchy and attached to the root coupled model seeing it as an atomic
  model. This implementation gives the programmer the choice over the two
  solutions when creating a coupled model given its submodels. The advantage
  of the tightly coupled solution is a better performance in general.</li>
<li>In the terminology of Lynch <i>et al.</i>, a hybrid automaton which can
  export and import continuous variables is called a hybrid input/output
  automaton (HIOA) while one that do not export or import continuous
  variables is called a timed input/output automaton (TIOA). The rationale
  behind this distinction was an answer from Lynch <i>et al.</i> to criticisms
  about the HIOA models as unable to capture the constraints of systems
  composed of decentralised artefacts communicating through digital networks,
  thus unable to share continuous variables (if they exploit the same variables,
  they must exchange discrete values of these variables through the network,
  not same the variable itself to get all of their values in continuous time;
  to be able to do that, a continuous time communication channel would be
  needed such as an analogical optical network with analogical data processing
  capabilities at both ends). The TIOA model allows to impose this kind of
  constraints and their composition can express the creation of decentralised
  artefacts from centralised or decentralised ones. This library implements
  the sharing of continuous variables among HIOA as the sharing of placeholders
  (objects) storing the values of the variables. This choice imposes that
  composed HIOA implemented as DEVS models must exist in the same address
  space (<i>i.e.</i>, the same process running the Java virtual machine). A
  consequence of this choice is that it is possible to run continuous
  simulation models in parallel within a JVM but not to do so in a distributed
  way among several JVM.</li>  
<li>In their 2000 book, Zeigler <i>et al.</i> proposes several slightly
  different coordination algorithms depending upon the type of atomic
  simulation models and engines. These algorithms lead to different
  implementations for specialised coupled models and coordination
  engines capable of coordinating homogeneous sets of similar submodels.
  However, to be able to coordinate an heterogeneous set of submodels,
  some kind of polymorphic coupled model and coordination engine is
  required. This implementation only proposes a polymorphic coupled
  model and a polymorphic coordination engine capable of coordinating
  all of the different kinds of models and simulation engines defined by
  the library (<i>i.e.</i>, standard DEVS models, event scheduling discrete
  events models and hybrid input/output automata models. Indeed, this
  implementation approach has the major drawback to force the modification
  of the classes defining coupled models and coordination engines to
  include each new types of simulation algorithm.</li>
<li>A lot of things are still to be done. It is not the goal of this work
  currently to develop a full implementation of DEVS, but rather to be used
  as a proof-of-concept used in a component model tailored for cyber-physical
  systems where components have behavioural models represented by hybrid
  automata implemented as DEVS simulation models. However, some additions
  are planned:
  <ul>
  <li>a real-time simulation algorithm will be added;</li>
  <li>when the time permits, an implementation of confluent transitions will
    also be done (at this time, they are not operational);</li>
  <li>the simulation time has a time unit, but currently the implementation
   forces all models in a simulation to have the same time unit; in the
   future heterogeneous time units among models should be added too.</li>
  </ul>
  </li> 
</ul>
