<p>
The event scheduling world view is the standard simulation model used in
stochastic discrete event simulations. See the following book for a very
well-known reference.
</p>
<p>
A.M. Law, Simulation Modeling and Analysis, McGraw-Hill Int'l, 4th edition,
2007.
</p>
<p>
This view can be implemented within the DEVS protocol by merely adapting
the implementation of its standard methods. The class
<code>AtomicES_Model</code> gives such an implementation and its javadoc
describes the choices made.
</p>
<p>
The implementation of event scheduling world view models in DEVS is presented
in the following text available on the WWW:
