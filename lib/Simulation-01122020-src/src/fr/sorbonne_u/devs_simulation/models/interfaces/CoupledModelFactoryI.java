/**
 * The interface <code>CoupledModelFactoryI</code> defines the shared
 * behaviours among coupled model factories.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An coupled model factory provides three principal methods, one that
 * creates coupled models represented as instances of a given model
 * representation class, one that creates atomic simulation engine and
 * another that creates a coordination engine, the last both as instances
 * of given classes that have been designed to run the coupled models
 * created by this factory.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When a programmer defines a type of coupled model, if he/she wants
 * to use a creation of simulation architectures through their description
 * as instances of <code>ModelArchitecture</code>, he/she will have the
 * possibility to provide a factory implementing this interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The protocol to use a coupled model factory first creates an instance
 * of factory, then sets the creation parameters for the coupled model,
 * and then the method <code>createCoupledModel</code> can be called to create a
 * model instance.
 * </p>
