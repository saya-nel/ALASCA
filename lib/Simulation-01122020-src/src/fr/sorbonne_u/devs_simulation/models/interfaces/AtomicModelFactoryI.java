/**
 * The interface <code>AtomicModelFactoryI</code> defines the shared
 * behaviours among atomic model factories.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An atomic model factory provides two principal methods, one that creates
 * atomic models represented as instances of a given model representation
 * class and another that creates a simulation engine instances of a given
 * class that has been designed to run the atomic models created by this
 * factory.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When a programmer defines a type of atomic model, if he/she wants
 * to use a creation of simulation architectures through their description
 * as instances of <code>ModelArchitecture</code>, he/she will have the
 * possibility to provide a factory implementing this interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The protocol to use an atomic model factory first creates an instance
 * of factory, then sets the creation parameters for the model, and then
 * the method <code>createAtomicModel</code> can be called to create a
 * model instance.
 * </p>
