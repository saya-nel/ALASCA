This package implements generic events for DEVS simulation models. Some classes
refer to events used at run time by the simulation. Others refer to the
description of the connections (event sources and sinks) in a simulation
architecture that describes models imported and exported events as well
as links from models exporting events to the ones importing them. This is
complicated by the fact that this library promotes the idea of reusable
models developed by independent teams. Hence, exported events may have to
be translated to imported ones when connecting independently developed
models. Similarly, a coupled model may import a type of event that needs to be
translated to another type before being imported by some submodels, as well
as exported events from submodels may have to be translated into the coupled
model types of exported events. Hence, event converter may need to be added
at connection time to cater for these translations, and converters may have
to be composed into a chain of translations in complex simulation
architectures.
