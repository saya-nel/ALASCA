 * The abstract class <code>AbstractEventConverter</code> defines the most
 * general information about event converters.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In DEVS, models can export events of a type t1 to a model that consumes
 * events of type t2 provided that a function is given to convert events of
 * type t1 into events of type t2. This allows to compose models that were
 * developed independently by providing the necessary glue at composition
 * time. As events exported or imported by submodels can also be shadowed
 * as events of different types re-exported or imported by their parent model,
 * the conversion also allows to also cater for that. Hence a event emitted
 * by a model can pass through several conversions before being consumed by
 * its destination model. Therefore, conversion functions need to be composed
 * to provide an end-to-end conversion.
