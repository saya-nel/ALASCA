<p><i>DEVS simulation architectures</i></p>

<p>
DEVS is a modular simulation model promoting both the possibility to define
discrete event simulation models that exchanges external events and the
ability to define customised simulation engines which can collaborate
together in heterogeneous simulations. To support this vision, DEVS
distinguishes atomic models, which implements user-defined simulation models
under a standard simulation protocol, and coupled models, which are built
from the composition of other models (atomic and coupled) in order to
coordinate the execution of the simulation runs.
</p>
<p>
A DEVS simulation model can be as simple as a single atomic model attached
to a simulation engine but also as complex as a hierarchy of coupled and
atomic models with different yet compatible simulation engine attached to
subtrees of models. 
</p>
<p>
This package defines the basis for an DEVS simulation architecture description
language. The class <code>Architecture</code> represents a simulation model
hierarchy by gathering all of the static information about their constituting
models and their composition relationships. Compared to a full-fledged
language, it resembles more an XML description or an object-oriented
representation of an abstract syntax tree.
</p>
<p>
A simulation architecture is defined at its base level by descriptions of
its simulation models distinguishing atomic and coupled model descriptions,
both providing information about what the models import and export while
coupled model descriptions also show the internal connections among its
submodels. The exact content of these descriptions depends upon the type of
models, therefore each of the model families must define their own model
descriptors.
</p>
<p>
The architectural description can check the consistency of the described model
architecture and then use this description to create the actual models and
connect them to get a running simulation code. To provide more flexibility,
an architecture needs not to be defined at once but can also be constructed
by progressively adding model descriptions. In this case, the consistency
check and the running simulation code can only be performed on completed
architecture description.
</p>
<p>
Constructing a running simulation model from an architecture description is
indeed a form of operational semantics given to the description language.
The construction is achieved by interpreting the description to create the
models and connect them. To do so, the running simulation model must be
created from the leaves of the model hierarchy to the root. When coupled
model must be created, they result from the composition of their submodels.
The operations required to perform such compositions depend on the type of
simulation models, hence each family of simulation model must define their
composition. Standard DEVS model composition involves connecting the coupled
model imported events to submodels that will consume them as well as connecting
exported events from submodels either to imported ones of other submodels or
to events reexported by the coupled model. These connections are implemented
by the class <code>ModelComposer</code> with its methods <code>compose</code>
and <code>composeAsAtomicModel</code>. When necessary, other families of
simulation models must extend this class, like the class
<code>HIOA_Composer</code> for HIOA models.
