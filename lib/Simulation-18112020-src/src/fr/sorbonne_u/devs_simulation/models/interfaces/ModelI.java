/**
 * The interface <code>ModelI</code> is the root of the type hierarchy defining

 * family of DEVS simulation engines.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * DEVS is a simulation protocol that implements modular discrete event
 * simulation models which can then be simulated in a centralised or
 * distributed way.

 * <p><i>Debugging facilities</i></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * DEVS models all share the fact that they have a unique identifier (URI), a
 * simulation time unit used by their simulation clock and a simulation engine
 * enacting them. Besides these standard services, models can be traced at
 * execution for debugging purposes. The interface defines methods to control
