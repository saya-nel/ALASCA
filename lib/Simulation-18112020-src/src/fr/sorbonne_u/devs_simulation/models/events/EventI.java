 * The interface <code>EventI</code> defines the most general methods required
 * in events.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An event is defined by its time of occurrence (in simulation clock time)
 * end a generic information describing the event itself. In discrete time
 * simulation, many events can occur at the same simulation clock time. A
 * priority order allows to define a total order of processing among these
 * events. This total order can be expressed in a dense time model (a couple
 * simulation time and index discriminating a countable number of co-occurring
 * events).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * All events manipulated in simulation models must directly or indirectly
 * implement this interface.
 * </p>
