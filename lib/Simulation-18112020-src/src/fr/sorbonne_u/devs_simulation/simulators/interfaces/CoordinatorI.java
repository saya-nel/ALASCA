/**
 * The interface <code>CoordinationI</code> defines the core behaviour of
 * DEVS coordination engines, extending the basic behaviour shared by all
 * simulation engines.
 *
 * <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
 * 
 * Coordination engines are organised in hierarchies where the lowest level
 * ones directly coordinate atomic engines while at the higher levels, they
 * coordinate mixes of atomic and coordination engines or only coordination
 * engines. In terms of interface, the sole new required methods concerns
 * the coordinated engines. In term of implementation, the methods declared
 * in the interface <code>SimulatorI</code> that defines the DEVS protocol
 * must be implemented to coordinate the coordinated engines.
